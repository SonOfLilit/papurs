A port of [SocaLabs PAPU VST](https://github.com/FigBug/PAPU/tree/master)'s audio engine (without UI) to Rust. Bit identical output on a large test suite.

Written 100% by Claude Code (planning by Opus 4.6, implementation by Sonnet 4.6, design review and test review by Aur Saraf).

The project was written entirely by Roland Rabien and is (c) to him except for the test utilities.
