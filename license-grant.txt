Hi,

You wrote here [1] that you try to release your synths with the most permissive license possible given their dependencies.

I see that PAPU is released as GPL and not LGPL. As far as I can tell, its audio engine only depends on Blargg's (wonderful!) stuff, which is all LGPL. Would you be open to relicensing your own code as LGPL?

Thanks (and thanks for your existing open source work!),
Aur
